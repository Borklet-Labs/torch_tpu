"""Holds the XLA commit and sha for easy automated updating."""

# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash. Using JAX's XLA commit
#    is a good reference point.
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/{git_hash}.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

XLA_COMMIT = "e570e84f6ce806c7702ab421430db6edaf44a218"
XLA_SHA256 = "200516e4532740614d7ea751bd64a3bb4d4a81cc0717b848a264ea14265a43b5"
