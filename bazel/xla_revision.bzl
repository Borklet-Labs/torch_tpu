"""Holds the XLA commit and sha for easy automated updating."""

# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash. Using JAX's XLA commit
#    is a good reference point.
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/{git_hash}.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

XLA_COMMIT = "ddf15ca00ef5693e02e2d870c8d720b7d8d060f6"
XLA_SHA256 = "32b7424d95534a41f2cc0f2c702e1d609fc0e69da1981fb133bdee72e15f72ea"
